       ggeettrruussaaggee() returns resource usage measures for _w_h_o, which can be one of the following:

       RRUUSSAAGGEE__SSEELLFF
              Return  resource  usage  statistics  for the calling process, which is the sum of resources
              used by all threads in the process.

       RRUUSSAAGGEE__CCHHIILLDDRREENN
              Return resource usage statistics for all children of the calling process that  have  termi‐
              nated  and been waited for.  These statistics will include the resources used by grandchil‐
              dren, and further removed descendants, if all of  the  intervening  descendants  waited  on
              their terminated children.

       RRUUSSAAGGEE__TTHHRREEAADD (since Linux 2.6.26)
              Return resource usage statistics for the calling thread.

       The  resource  usages  are  returned in the structure pointed to by _u_s_a_g_e, which has the following
       form:

           struct rusage {
               struct timeval ru_utime; /* user CPU time used */
               struct timeval ru_stime; /* system CPU time used */
               long   ru_maxrss;        /* maximum resident set size */
               long   ru_ixrss;         /* integral shared memory size */
               long   ru_idrss;         /* integral unshared data size */
               long   ru_isrss;         /* integral unshared stack size */
               long   ru_minflt;        /* page reclaims (soft page faults) */
               long   ru_majflt;        /* page faults (hard page faults) */
               long   ru_nswap;         /* swaps */
               long   ru_inblock;       /* block input operations */
               long   ru_oublock;       /* block output operations */
               long   ru_msgsnd;        /* IPC messages sent */
               long   ru_msgrcv;        /* IPC messages received */
               long   ru_nsignals;      /* signals received */
               long   ru_nvcsw;         /* voluntary context switches */
               long   ru_nivcsw;        /* involuntary context switches */
           };

       Not all fields are completed; unmaintained fields are set to zero by  the  kernel.   (The  unmain‐
       tained  fields  are provided for compatibility with other systems, and because they may one day be
       supported on Linux.)  The fields are interpreted as follows:

       _r_u___u_t_i_m_e
              This is the total amount of time spent executing in  user  mode,  expressed  in  a  _t_i_m_e_v_a_l
              structure (seconds plus microseconds).

       _r_u___s_t_i_m_e
              This  is  the  total  amount of time spent executing in kernel mode, expressed in a _t_i_m_e_v_a_l
              structure (seconds plus microseconds).

       _r_u___m_a_x_r_s_s (since Linux 2.6.32)
              This is the maximum resident set size used (in kilobytes).  For  RRUUSSAAGGEE__CCHHIILLDDRREENN,  this  is
              the  resident  set  size  of  the  largest  child, not the maximum resident set size of the
              process tree.

       _r_u___i_x_r_s_s (unmaintained)
              This field is currently unused on Linux.

       _r_u___i_d_r_s_s (unmaintained)
              This field is currently unused on Linux.

       _r_u___i_s_r_s_s (unmaintained)
              This field is currently unused on Linux.

       _r_u___m_i_n_f_l_t
              The number of page faults serviced without any I/O activity; here I/O activity  is  avoided
              by “reclaiming” a page frame from the list of pages awaiting reallocation.

       _r_u___m_a_j_f_l_t
              The number of page faults serviced that required I/O activity.

       _r_u___n_s_w_a_p (unmaintained)
              This field is currently unused on Linux.

       _r_u___i_n_b_l_o_c_k (since Linux 2.6.22)
              The number of times the filesystem had to perform input.

       _r_u___o_u_b_l_o_c_k (since Linux 2.6.22)
              The number of times the filesystem had to perform output.

       _r_u___m_s_g_s_n_d (unmaintained)
              This field is currently unused on Linux.

       _r_u___m_s_g_r_c_v (unmaintained)
              This field is currently unused on Linux.

       _r_u___n_s_i_g_n_a_l_s (unmaintained)
              This field is currently unused on Linux.

       _r_u___n_v_c_s_w (since Linux 2.6)
              The  number  of  times a context switch resulted due to a process voluntarily giving up the
              processor before its  time  slice  was  completed  (usually  to  await  availability  of  a
              resource).

       _r_u___n_i_v_c_s_w (since Linux 2.6)
              The  number  of  times  a context switch resulted due to a higher priority process becoming
              runnable or because the current process exceeded its time slice.

RREETTUURRNN VVAALLUUEE
       On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and _e_r_r_n_o is set appropriately.

EERRRROORRSS
       EEFFAAUULLTT _u_s_a_g_e points outside the accessible address space.

       EEIINNVVAALL _w_h_o is invalid.

CCOONNFFOORRMMIINNGG TTOO
       SVr4, 4.3BSD.  POSIX.1-2001 specifies ggeettrruussaaggee(), but specifies  only  the  fields  _r_u___u_t_i_m_e  and
       _r_u___s_t_i_m_e.

       RRUUSSAAGGEE__TTHHRREEAADD is Linux-specific.

NNOOTTEESS
       Resource usage metrics are preserved across an eexxeeccvvee(2).

       Including  _<_s_y_s_/_t_i_m_e_._h_>  is  not  required these days, but increases portability.  (Indeed, _s_t_r_u_c_t
       _t_i_m_e_v_a_l is defined in _<_s_y_s_/_t_i_m_e_._h_>.)

       In Linux kernel versions before 2.6.9, if the disposition of SSIIGGCCHHLLDD is set to  SSIIGG__IIGGNN  then  the
       resource  usages  of  child  processes  are  automatically  included  in  the  value  returned  by
       RRUUSSAAGGEE__CCHHIILLDDRREENN, although POSIX.1-2001 explicitly prohibits this.  This nonconformance  is  recti‐
       fied in Linux 2.6.9 and later.

       The structure definition shown at the start of this page was taken from 4.3BSD Reno.

       Ancient  systems provided a vvttiimmeess() function with a similar purpose to ggeettrruussaaggee().  For backward
       compatibility, glibc also provides  vvttiimmeess().   All  new  applications  should  be  written  using
       ggeettrruussaaggee().
